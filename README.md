## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run Snakee Game, you need a web browser that supports HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game.

## Usage
- Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to control the direction of the snake.
- The objective is to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer.
